### Concepts Covered in this Project:

1. **Point Intensity Transformations:**
   - Understanding and applying point intensity transformations to modify or enhance the quality of digital images. This includes adjustments to brightness, contrast, and color correction on a pixel-by-pixel basis.

2. **Histogram Analysis and Manipulation:**
   - Drawing and analyzing histograms for grayscale and color images to evaluate brightness contrast and dynamic range.
   - Implementing histogram stretching and equalization to improve the visual quality of images by adjusting intensity distributions.

3. **Contrast Enhancement Techniques:**
   - Applying linear transformation functions to increase image contrast, making details more distinguishable in both dark and bright areas.
   - Converting image negatives to more suitable representations through linear transformations.

4. **Logarithmic Intensity Transformation:**
   - Using logarithmic functions to enhance the visibility of details in darker regions of an image, thereby improving contrast in low-intensity areas.

5. **Histogram Stretching and Equalization:**
   - Implementing histogram stretching to extend the range of intensity values and enhance contrast.
   - Performing histogram equalization to uniformly distribute intensity values across the entire image, leading to improved overall contrast.

6. **Image Filtering Techniques:**
   - Implementing various linear and non-linear filters for image enhancement and noise reduction.
   - Understanding the application of convolution operations using kernels (e.g., average filters, Gaussian filters) to smooth images.

7. **Edge Detection Techniques:**
   - Implementing the Sobel filter to detect edges and identify changes in intensity in both horizontal and vertical directions.
   - Comparing the effectiveness of edge detection before and after applying contrast enhancement techniques.

8. **Combining Image Processing Techniques:**
   - Exploring the combination of different image processing techniques (e.g., Sobel edge detection followed by contrast enhancement) to achieve better image analysis results.
   - Evaluating and comparing the results of various processing pipelines to optimize image quality and feature detection.
