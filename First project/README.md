1. **Image Loading and Display**: Understanding how to read and display images in both RGB and BGR formats using image processing libraries.
  
2. **Pixel Manipulation**: Accessing and modifying pixel values in an image, which is fundamental in image processing tasks.
  
3. **Image Attributes**: Extracting and understanding various image properties such as dimensions, number of channels, data types, and total pixel count.

4. **Region of Interest (ROI) Selection**: Selecting and manipulating specific regions of an image, which is crucial for tasks like object detection.

5. **Channel Splitting and Merging**: Working with individual color channels (Red, Green, Blue) of an image, and combining them to manipulate colors or emphasize specific channels.

6. **Arithmetic Operations on Images**: Performing arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations on images for various effects and transformations.

7. **Image Rotation**: Implementing custom image rotation by manipulating pixel positions based on trigonometric transformations without relying on interpolation functions, which provides insight into the geometric manipulation of images.

8. **Contrast and Brightness Adjustment**: Adjusting the contrast and brightness of images to enhance visual quality, especially in low-light conditions.
