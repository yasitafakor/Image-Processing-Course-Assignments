### 1. **Image Resolution and DPI Calculation**:
   - **Understanding Image Resolution**: Calculating the resolution required for an image to fit within specified dimensions in both metric (mm) and imperial (inches) units.
   - **DPI (Dots Per Inch) Calculation**: Converting image resolution into DPI, which is critical for printing and displaying images with the desired quality.

### 2. **Image Conversion Techniques**:
   - **Grayscale Conversion**: Reducing a color image to a single channel that represents the intensity of each pixel, simplifying the image for further processing.
   - **Binary Image Conversion**: Converting an image to a binary format, where each pixel is either fully black or fully white, often using thresholding techniques.

### 3. **Image Thresholding and Pixel Categorization**:
   - **Custom Thresholding**: Dividing the pixel intensity range (0-255) into multiple categories (based on a parameter `k`) and assigning a representative value for each category.

### 4. **Image Resizing**:
   - **Scaling Images**: Resizing images to specific dimensions or scaling by a factor, while preserving the aspect ratio or altering it as needed.
   - **Preserving Aspect Ratio**: Ensuring the imageâ€™s original proportions are maintained during resizing operations.

### 5. **Histogram Analysis**:
   - **Histogram Representation**: Visualizing the distribution of pixel intensities in an image, which is essential for tasks like contrast adjustment, thresholding, and image quality enhancement.
   - **Comparing Histograms**: Analyzing histograms for different types of images (grayscale, binary) and explaining the differences based on image content and pixel intensity distribution.
